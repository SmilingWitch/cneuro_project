                        <p>In our study, we decided to implement four methods as baselines. Two of these methods were based on image analysis, while another method was based on the combination of chest X-ray (CXR) image classification, radiomic features, and an additional method focused solely on CXR image classification. Additionally, we developed two methods based on clinical data classification, specifically adapting them to the characteristics of our own clinical data. These strategies allowed us to evaluate different approaches in predicting the outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Cuba.</p>
